                Who enjoy playing the game, even when you have 4 random strangers on your team. As the sole engineer of LFGamer I have played LOL
                for 11 years, on and off at times and when you play with 4 strangers constantly, the game can get pretty boring, especially without 
                additional communication. That's why I decided to build LFGamer. That way we have the chance to find other like-minded individuals who
                want to have a parter going into Solo/Duo queue to give them the upperhand.</p>
